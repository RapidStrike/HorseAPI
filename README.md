# HorseAPI üê¥

A simple, RESTful API written in Flask for fetching information related to the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. URL and documentation to be added soon.

You can access the API at http://api.gollygeewhiz.xyz

## Example Response

For now, you can only retrieve episode information. Fetching <b>S4E21: Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3</b> would return the following:

```json
{
  "air_date": "1396711800", 
  "episode": 21, 
  "season": 4,
  "synopsis": "Rainbow Dash uses unconventional methods to prepare for her test to become a member of the Wonderbolts Reserves.", 
  "title": "Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3"
}
```

The `air_date` field is a Unix timestamp representation of when the episode first officially aired on The Hub/Discovery Family Network. A `synopsis` field may also be returned, which is just the information pulled from zap2it.tv listings.

Certain methods will also return a list of episode objects.

## Methods
